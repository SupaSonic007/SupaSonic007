Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Josh and I have been working with IT since about 2015. I am passionate about IT and aspire to enhance my skills as I explore the endless possibilities it has to offer.

I have developed a love of Web Development and Cyber Security recently and hope I can pursue those areas in the future, but as it's a bit more difficult to show, I will be creating mostly web projects here, or anything else that may interest me at the time.

Feel free to have a look anytime on my website, [joshey007.dev](https://joshey007.dev) or GitHub home page for updates on myself and my projects. You can also go view the site I had previously [joush007.github.io](joush007.github.io) (Yes I know I have 3 different names across these profiles/websites, but I am now sticking with joshey007) which contains everything I did before graduating, including my 3 largest projects during school. The links to projects may not work as I transferred the projects to this account
