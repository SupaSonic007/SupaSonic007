Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**MAXIMUM SECURITY**\
**MINIMUM EFFORT**

I am Josh and I have been working with IT for eight years. I am passionate about IT and aspire to enhance my skills as I explore the endless possibilities it has to offer.

I have developed a love of Web Development and Cyber Security recently and hope I can pursue those areas in the future, but as it's a bit more difficult to show, I will be creating mostly web projects here, or anything else that may interest me at the time.

Feel free to have a look anytime on my home page or [website](supasonic007.github.io) for updates on myself and my projects. (Or you can go view the site I had previously [joush007.github.io](joush007.github.io) which contains everything I did before graduating, including my 3 largest projects during school)
